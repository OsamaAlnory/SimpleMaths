startup.first.label:
%name% is an app which helps you to understand some
<nobr> of the concepts that lie behind mathematics and programming.
Many things become much easier to understand when visualized.
<nobr> This is much helpful when it comes to creating different kinds of games.
<nobr> For instance, a 3D rotation of a point can be used to create 3D shapes and rotate them.

golden_ratio.main:
Suppose you have a line that is divided into, let's say, a and b.
<nobr> In this case, it's pretty obvious that the length of the line is a+b.
<nobr> If the ratio between the longer piece and the line "a+b" is equal to
<nobr> the ratio between the shorter piece and the longer piece, we get what is known as
<nobr> The Golden Ratio which is approximated to be 1.6180339.
<end>

golden_ratio.2:
There's actually a simple formula for calculating the value of the golden ratio:
<end>
golden_ratio.3:
As it appears, the formula is recursive meaning that as you perform more calculation,
<nobr> you will get closer and closer to the real value.

We can pick any number we want. In this case we have:
