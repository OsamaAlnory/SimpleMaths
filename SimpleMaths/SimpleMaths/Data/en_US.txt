Welcome to %name%!
<end>

startup.first.label:
%name% is an app which helps you to understand some
<nobr> of the concepts that lie behind mathematics and programming.
Many things become much easier to understand when visualized.
<nobr> This is much helpful when it comes to creating different kinds of games.
<nobr> For instance, a 3D rotation of a point can be used to create 3D shapes and rotate them.
<end>

golden_ratio.main:
Suppose you have a line that is divided into, let's say, a and b.
<nobr> In this case, it's pretty obvious that the length of the line is a+b.
<nobr> If the ratio between the longer piece and the line "a+b" is equal to
<nobr> the ratio between the shorter piece and the longer piece, we get what is known as
<nobr> The Golden Ratio which is approximated to be 1.6180339.
<end>

golden_ratio.2:
There's actually a simple formula for calculating the value of the golden ratio:
<end>
golden_ratio.3:
As it appears, the formula is recursive meaning that as you perform more calculation,
<nobr> you will get closer and closer to the real value.

We can pick any number we want, say 2, then 

<end>


ifsats_main:
An if statement is a programming conditional statement that,
<nobr> if proved true, performs a function or displays information.
<end>

ifsats.1:
Below is a general example of an if statement:
<end>

ifsats.2:

int X = 5;

if (X < 10) {
     Consol.WriteLine ("Hello John");
}
 
 The output is : Hello John
<end>

ifsats.3:
int X = 30;

if (X == 10) { 
  Consol.WriteLine ("The value of X equals to 10");
}
else { 
Consol.WriteLine ("Value of X is not equal to 10");
 }

  The output is : Value of X is not equal to 10

<end>

ifsats.4:
int X = 10;

if (X > 10) { 
Consol.WriteLine ("Value of X is greater than 10");
 }
elsif (X < 10) { 
Consol.WriteLine ("Value of X is less than 10");
 }
else {
Consol.WriteLine ("The value of X equals to 10");
}
  
  The output is : The value of X equals to 10

<end>

ifsats.5:
 

if (X == 10) { 
  Consol.WriteLine ("The value of X equals to 10");
}
else { 
Consol.WriteLine ("Value of X is not equal to 10");
 }
<end>
